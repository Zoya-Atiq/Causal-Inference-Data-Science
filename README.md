Welcome to my Causal Inference & Data Science Portfolio!  
This repository highlights my analytical expertise across **data analysis, machine learning, causal inference, econometrics, and SQL**.  
It includes end-to-end projects demonstrating statistical rigor, reproducible workflows, and clear business-oriented insights.

## 🚀 About This Portfolio  
This portfolio is organized into four major themes:  

### **1. Causal Inference & Econometrics**  
Projects applying modern and classical causal estimation techniques to real and synthetic datasets.  
Focus areas include:  
- Difference-in-Differences  
- Synthetic Control  
- Regression Discontinuity  
- Causal Forests (meta-learners)  
- Propensity score methods  
- A/B testing and experimental design  

### **2. Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling**  
End-to-end workflows including EDA, feature engineering, model development, hyperparameter tuning, performance evaluation, and deployment-style packaging.

### **3. Data Analysis & Visualization**  
Exploratory analysis using pandas, R, visualization libraries, dashboards, and storytelling with data.

### **4. SQL Analytics & Data Pipelines**  
Advanced SQL queries, optimization tasks, data modeling, and analytics engineering style transformations.
